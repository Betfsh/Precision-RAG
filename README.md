# Precision-RAG:Prompt tuning for building enterprise grade RAG systems

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an enterprise-grade system for prompt tuning, specifically designed for building robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The system will provide automated prompt generation, evaluation data generation, and prompt testing and ranking functionalities. By addressing the challenges of prompt engineering, we aim to optimize the use of Language Models (LLMs) in various industries, enhancing decision-making, operational efficiency, and customer experience.

### Business Objective
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role on Language Models (LLMs) cannot be underestimated. It serves as a crucial factor in boosting the performance of LLMs. To transform how businesses engage with LLMs, three key services to address this challenge effectively have been identified.The objective is to revolutionize the way industries harness the power of AI. By making LLM technology more accessible, efficient, and effective,businesses across various sectors can be empowered. To achieve this, main focus lies in the following key services:


**1. Automatic Prompt Generation Service: This service streamlines the process of creating effective prompts, reducing the time and expertise required in crafting prompts manually.

**2. Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service: Our system automates the generation of diverse test cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage and identifying potential issues. This saves           significant time in the Quality Assurance (QA) process.

**3. Prompt Testing and Ranking Service: We evaluate and rank different prompts based on their effectiveness, helping users achieve the desired outcomes from LLMs. This ensures accurate and        contextually relevant responses from chatbots and virtual assistants, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
## Steps in the project 

## design and develop a prompt generation system that allows users to input a description of their objective or task. The system should then generate multiple prompt options based on the provided information. Sophisticated algorithms should be employed to ensure the generation of diverse and relevant prompt candidates. Additionally, the system should include evaluation metrics to check the alignment of the generated prompt candidates with the input description.
