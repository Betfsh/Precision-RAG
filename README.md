# Precision-RAG:Prompt tuning for building enterprise grade RAG systems

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an enterprise-grade system for prompt tuning, specifically designed for building robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The system will provide automated prompt generation, evaluation data generation, and prompt testing and ranking functionalities. By addressing the challenges of prompt engineering, we aim to optimize the use of Language Models (LLMs) in various industries, enhancing decision-making, operational efficiency, and customer experience.

### Business Objective
Prompt engineering plays a crucial role on Language Models (LLMs) cannot be underestimated. It serves as a crucial factor in boosting the performance of LLMs. To transform how businesses engage with LLMs, three key services to address this challenge effectively have been identified.The objective is to revolutionize the way industries harness the power of AI. By making LLM technology more accessible, efficient, and effective,businesses across various sectors can be empowered. To achieve this, main focus lies in the following key services:


_ **. Automatic Prompt Generation Service: This service streamlines the process of creating effective prompts, reducing the time and expertise required in crafting prompts manually.

_ **. Automatic Evaluation Data Generation Service: Our system automates the generation of diverse test cases, ensuring comprehensive coverage and identifying potential issues. This saves           significant time in the Quality Assurance (QA) process.

_ **. Prompt Testing and Ranking Service: We evaluate and rank different prompts based on their effectiveness, helping users achieve the desired outcomes from LLMs. This ensures accurate and contextually relevant responses from chatbots and virtual assistants, improving user engagement and satisfaction.

## Introduction
This project focuses on fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to improve embedding quality and text generation capabilities for Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba languages. The goal is to create models that better understand and generate text in these languages, which are underrepresented in current NLP research.

## Project Overview
The project includes the following components:
- Data collection and preprocessing for Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained language models on the collected data.
- Evaluating the performance of the fine-tuned models.
- Deploying the models for real-world applications.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment using Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    python3.10 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. To fine-tune the model, run:
    ```bash
    python train.py --config configs/finetune_config.yaml
    ```

2. To generate text using the fine-tuned model, run:
    ```bash
    python generate.py --input "Your input text here"
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of text data in Amharic, Swahili, and Yoruba languages sourced from various online repositories and cleaned for training. The datasets are stored in the `data/` directory.

## Model Training and Fine-Tuning
The models are trained using the `train.py` script. Configuration files in the `configs/` directory define the training parameters and model architecture.

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated based on:
- Embedding quality
- Text generation fluency
- Contextual understanding

Detailed results are documented in the `results/` directory.

## Challenges
- Scarcity of quality data for underrepresented languages.
- Computational resource limitations for training large models.
- Ensuring ethical use and bias mitigation in language models.

## Future Work
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse sources.
- Experiment with different model architectures.
- Improve deployment pipelines for real-time applications.
